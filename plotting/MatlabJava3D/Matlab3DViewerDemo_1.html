%% MATLAB 3D viewer demo 1
%
% This example demonstrates how to use Miji to render a volume in 3D using
% accelerated graphics, if your computer is adequately equiped (most
% computers are, these days). We use the well known 'mri' data distributed
% with MATLAB, and render it in the ImageJ 3D viewer.

%% Make sure Java3D is installed
% If not, try to install it

if ~IsJava3DInstalled(true)
    return
end

%% Load and prepare data using MATLAB
% Load an example of 3D data from standard Matlab
load('mri.mat');

%%
% Make a simple 8-bit 3D image from it. There is a singleton dimension to
% remove.
I = squeeze(D);

%%
% Ok, now this is an indexed color image (even if it is made a grays). The
% actual color mapping is contained in the 'map' variable. We will make a
% RGB image out of it.
[R G B] = ind2rgb(I, map);

%%
% Just a short note here: we are going a complicated way to regenerate a
% color image from an indexed image and its color mapping, because this is
% the way the data is shipped to us in that MATLAB sample. It is a step
% proper to MATLAB only, and does not affect nor relate to the Miji
% framework we demonstrate here.
% We could skip this step by directly feeding the image 'I' to MIJ, instead
% of the color image 'J', using another method. The colors would not be
% right, but would be enough to demonstrate the 3D rendering.
% However, let us do things properly.

%%
% An extra step to do: R, G and B now contains doubles (0 to 1), and we
% would like to make 3 channels of uint8 out of them.
R  = uint8(255 * R);
G  = uint8(255 * G);
B  = uint8(255 * B);

%%
% We now put them together into one 3D color image (that is, with 4D). To
% do so, we simply concatenate them along the 3th dimension.
J = cat(4, R,G,B);

%%
% A note here: MIJ expects the dimensions of a 3D color image to be the
% following: [ x y z color ]; this is why we did this 'cat' operation just
% above. However, if you want to display the data in MATLAB's native
% implay, they must be in the following order: [ x y color z ]. In the
% latter case, 'permute' is your friend.

%% Configure data volume using ImageJ objects
% Now we start the fun and new part.
% Everything so far has been only about MATLAB operations.

%%
% First, we launch Miji. Here we use the launcher in non-interactive mode.
% The only thing that this will do is actually to set the path so that the
% subsequent commands and classes can be found by Matlab.
% We launched it with a 'false' in argument, to specify that we do not want
% to diplay the ImageJ toolbar. Indeed, this example is a command line
% example, so we choose not to display the GUI. Feel free to experiment.
Miji(false)

%%
% The 3D viewer can only display ImagePlus. ImagePlus is the way ImageJ
% represent images. We can't feed it directly MATLAB data. Fortunately,
% that is where MIJ comes into handy. It has a function that can create an
% ImagePlus from a Matlab object.
% 1. The first argument is the name we will give to the image.
% 2. The second argument is the Matlab data
% 3. The last argument is a boolean. If true, the ImagePlus will be
% displayed as an image sequence. You might find this useful as well.
imp = MIJ.createColor('MRI data', J, false);

%%
% Since we had a color volume (4D data), we used the createColor method. If
% we had only a grayscale volume (3D data), we could have used the
% createImage method instead, which works the same.

%%
% Now comes a little non-mandatory tricky bit.
% By default, the 3D viewer will assume that the image voxel is square,
% that is, every voxel has a size of 1 in the X, Y and Z direction.
% However, for the MRI data we are playing with, this is incorrect, as a
% voxel is 2.5 times larger in the Z direction that in the X and Y
% direction.
% If we do not correct that, the head we are trying to display will look
% flat.
% A way to tell this to the 3D viewer is to create a Calibration object and
% set its public field pixelDepth to 2.5. Then we set this object to be the
% calibration of the ImagePlus, and the 3D viewer will be able to deal with
% it.
calibration = ij.measure.Calibration();
calibration.pixelDepth = 2.5;
imp.setCalibration(calibration);

%% Display the data in ImageJ 3D viewer
% Now for the display itself.
%
% We create an empty 3D viewer to start with. We do not show it yet.
universe = ij3d.Image3DUniverse();

%%
% Now we show the 3D viewer window.
universe.show();

%%
% Then we send it the data, and ask it to be displayed as a volumetric
% rendering.
c = universe.addVoltex(imp);
%%
% Et voilà!
